Caedo HTTPd v.0.4 BETA
-----------------------
This is a special release for PSCODE.

Step 1:
-------

You must download the VBZLIB application extension. It is
simply the ZLIB dll that allows us to GZIP (compress) files for sending.

DOWNLOAD IT HERE: http://caedo.0web.org/files/vzlib.dll


Step 2:
-------

Place this file in the same folder as the source code. Put it
in the exact same directory as the file Caedo HTTPd.vbp
